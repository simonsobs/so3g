# For coordinate systems we use the following abbreviations:
#
# - DC: Detector coordinates
# - FP: Focal plane coordinates
# - CS: Celestial spherical coordinates (likely equatorial)
# - NS: Native spherical coordinates of the map projection
#
# Saying that a quaternion rotation q_B<A "takes A to B", where A and
# B are coordinate systems, means that if a vector has coordinates v_A
# in system A then its coordinates in system B are:
#
#      v_B = q_B<A v_A q_B<A*
#
# The rotation taking detector coordinates to native spherical
# coordinates is the product
#
#     q_NS<DC = q_NS<CS q_CS<FP q_FP<DC
#
# In this module, quaternion rotations are written as:
# - Q_CS<FP: Assembly.Q (vector in samples)
# - Q_FP<DC: Assembly.dets (vector in dets)
# - Q_NS<CS: Projectionst.q_celestial_to_native
#
# The Projectionist caches a vector of Q_NS<FP, which is then simply
# called "q_native".  This is usually the thing to pass to C++ level.


class Projectionist:
    """This class assists with analyzing WCS information to populate data
    structures needed for accelerated pointing routines.

    On instantiation, it carries information about the relation
    between celestial spherical coordinates and the Native Spherical
    coordinates of the projection, and also the pixelization scheme
    for the projection.

    As in pixell, the code and discussion here uses the term
    "geometry" to refer to the combination of an astropy.WCS object
    and a 2-d array shape.

    The following symbols are used in docstrings to represent shapes:

    * ``n_dets`` - Number of detectors in the focal plane.
    * ``n_samps`` - Number of samples in the signal space of each detector.
    * ``n_threads`` - Number of threads to use in parallelized computation.
    * ``n_mapidx`` - Number of indices required to specify a pixel in
      a map.  For simple maps this is probably 2, with the first index
      specifying row and the second index specifying column.  But for
      tiled maps n_mapidx is 3, with the first axis specifying the
      tile number.
    * ``n_comp`` - Number of map components, such as Stokes components
      or other spin components.  This takes the value 3, for example,
      if projection into TQU space has been requested.

    When coordinate computation or projection routines are called, a
    ProjEng (a wrapped C++ object) is instantiated to perform the
    accelerated computations.  The spin-composition (i.e. is this a
    'T' map or a 'TQU' map) must be specified at this time, to
    instantiate the correct accelerated object.

    Some method parameters are common to many functions and are documented
    here for consistency:

    * ``assembly`` - an Assembly, providing a focal plane (quaternion
      offsets for each detector) as well as a boresight vector
      (quaternion for each time sample).
    * ``comps`` - a string specifying the Stokes components of the
      map, for example 'T' or 'TQU'.  When absent, this will be
      guessed from the map shape; with 1|2|3 mapping to 'T'|'QU'|'TQU'
      respectively.
    * ``proj_name`` - a string specifying a projection.  The
      nomenclature is mostly the same as the FITS CTYPE identifiers.
      Accepted values: ARC, CAR, CEA, TAN, ZEA, Flat, Quat.
    * ``shape`` - the shape describing the celestial axes of the map.
      (For tiled representation this specifies the parent footprint.)
    * ``wcs`` - the WCS describing the celestial axes of the map.
      Together with ``shape`` this is a geometry; see pixell.enmap
      documentation.
    * ``threads`` - the thread assignment, consisting of a list of
      RangesMatrix objects.  Each RangesMatrix object must have shape
      (n_threads, n_dets, n_samps).  The n_threads does not need to
      be the same for every entry in the list.  In TOD-to-map
      operations, each entry of this list is processed fully before
      proceeding to the next one.  Each entry "ranges" is processed
      using (up to) the specified number of threads, such that thread
      i performs operations only on the samples included in
      ranges[i,:,:].  Most thread assignment routines in this module
      will return a list of two RangesMatrix objects,
      [ranges_parallel, ranges_serial].  The first item represents the
      part of the computation that can be done in parallel, and has
      shape (n_threads, n_dets, n_samps).  The ranges_serial object
      has shape (1, n_dets, n_samps) and represents any samples that
      need to be treated in a single thread.  The ranges_serial is
      only non-trivial when interpolation is active.
    * ``interpol``: How positions that fall between pixel centers will
      be handled. Options are "nearest" (default): Use Nearest
      Neighbor interpolation, so a sample takes the value of
      whatever pixel is closest; or "bilinear": linearly
      interpolate between the four closest pixels. bilinear is
      slower (around 60%) but avoids problems caused by a
      discontinuous model.

    Attributes:
        naxis: 2-element integer array specifying the map shape (for
            the 2 celestial axes).
        cdelt: 2-element float array specifying the pixel pitch.
        crpix: 2-element float array specifying the pixel coordinates
            of the reference point.
        proj_name: string, name of the projection.
        q_celestial_to_native: quaternion rotation taking celestial
            coordinates to the native spherical coordinates of the
            projection.
        tile_shape: 2-element integer array specifying the tile shape
            (this is the shape of one full-size sub-tile, not the
            decimation factor on each axis).
        tiling: a _Tiling object if the map is tiled, None otherwise.

        chosen, though this method does not provide fine-grained
        control of algorithm parameters and instead seeks to apply
        reasonable defaults.

        The methods exposed here are:

        - ``'simple'``: Divides the map into n_threads horizontal
          bands, and assigns the pixels in each band to a single
          thread.  This tends to be bad for scans that aren't
          horizontally correlated, or that don't have equal weight
          throughout the map.  The 'domdir' algorithm addresses both
          of those problems.
        - ``'domdir'``: For constant elevation scans, determines the
          dominant scan direction in the map and divides it into bands
          parallel to that scan direction.  The thickness of bands is
          adjusted so roughly equal numbers of samples fall into each
          band.
        - ``'tiles'``: In Tiled projections, assign each tile to a
          thread.  Some effort is made to balance the total number of
          samples over the threads.

        The returned object can be passed to the ``threads`` argument
        of the projection methods in this class.
