Introduction
============

The so3g library is a key component of the Simons Observatory (SO)
Data Acquisition (DAQ) and time-ordered data (TOD) analysis systems.
It consists of a mixture of C++ and Python modules providing:

- Extensions of the spt3g_software G3Frame framework for SO data
  transport needs.
- High-performance compiled code for TOD analysis operations.
